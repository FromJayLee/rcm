# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview
Web-based generator that lets small SaaS founders create high-quality testimonial image cards for their landing pages in under one minute through a fixed 3-step workflow: 1) choose template & edit content, 2) style background, 3) export at desired resolution. The app guarantees aspect-ratio lock and pixel-perfect alignment from edit to export.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
| Goal | Metric | Target for MVP |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| Reduce creation time | Avg. time from landing to export | < 60 seconds |
| Validate willingness to pay | Free-to-paid conversion rate | ≥ 10% within 30 days |
| User activation | Card export completion rate | ≥ 60% of sign-ups |
| Market traction | Product Hunt upvotes | 250+ on launch day |

## 3. Target Users
Primary: English-speaking solo/ small-team SaaS developers who manage their own marketing assets.
Secondary: Growth marketers in startups (1-50 employees).

## 4. Core Pain Points
1. Wasting time configuring design tools for simple testimonial graphics.
2. Maintaining brand consistency across multiple ratios/ resolutions.
3. Switching between tools to resize exports for different placements.

## 5. Key Use Case
A SaaS founder needs five testimonial images for a pricing-page A/B test tonight. She lands on our site, signs in, completes the 3-step flow, downloads square and landscape versions in under a minute, and embeds them into Webflow.

## 6. Product Features (MVP)
### Must-Have
1. Template Gallery (5 preset templates T1–T5 with dummy data)
2. Content Editor Panel (rating, quote text, author name, role/company, avatar upload, anonymous toggle, light/dark)
3. Canvas with locked aspect-ratio presets (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, 1.91:1, 3:2, 9:16)
4. Background Styler (solid, gradient, image upload)
5. Export Step: resolution presets + custom, PNG/JPG, 1×/2×, background include toggle, file naming
6. Responsive web UI
7. Dark-mode card option (template variant)
8. Landing page with marketing funnel & token purchase CTA

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
1. Drag-and-drop uploads
2. Undo/Redo history
3. Team collaboration & brand kits
4. API / bulk generation endpoint

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
• Performance: first meaningful paint < 2.5 s on 4G
• Accessibility: contrast ≥ 4.5:1, keyboard navigable
• Consistency: exported image layout matches editor 1:1 at any resolution
• Security: GDPR compliant, token payments via Stripe
• Availability: 99.5% uptime

## 8. Pricing & Monetisation
Pay-as-you-go: users purchase token packs (e.g., 20 exports for $10). Landing page promotes free tier with watermark or low-res download, upgrade via Stripe checkout.

## 9. Technical Approach
• Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, lucide-react, supabase (auth + storage), @tanstack/react-query, date-fns.
• Image rendering via canvas & html-to-png library (es-toolkit) on client; fallback SSR for 2× exports via serverless function.
• Supabase Storage for uploaded avatars/backgrounds.

## 10. Assumptions
1. English-only UI is acceptable to initial user base.
2. SaaS founders are willing to pay ~$0.50 per export if value is proven.
3. 3-step workflow is intuitive without onboarding videos.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Canva releases similar SaaS templates | High | High | Focus on speed, API roadmap, community engagement |
| Free competitors saturate SEO | Med | Med | Offer generous free tier but watermark, optimise Product Hunt launch |
| Image rendering glitches across ratios | Med | High | Automated regression tests across all presets |

## 12. Timeline (MVP)
| Phase | Duration | Milestones |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| Design & Spec | 1 wk | Finalise PRD, wireframes |
| Sprint 1 | 2 wks | Template gallery, content editor |
| Sprint 2 | 2 wks | Background styler, canvas ratio lock |
| Sprint 3 | 2 wks | Export flow, image rendering accuracy tests |
| Launch Prep | 1 wk | Landing page, Stripe tokens, analytics |
| Public Launch | Day 0 | Product Hunt & Indie Hackers |

## 13. Out of Scope (MVP)
• Drag-and-drop uploads, undo/redo, team collaboration, multilanguage UI, AI copy suggestions
